            <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
            
            <p>My name’s Michelle, and I’m a master’s student at the School of Information. Ever since taking a Disability Studies course in undergrad, I’ve been interested in this topic. Naturally, then, I chose to create a website about disability rights activism!</p>

            <p>This website will focus on activism within the United States from 1817 to the present. I know there’s much going on in this space around the world. However, I didn’t want to have a focus so broad that I lost the nuances of each country’s history of activism.</p>

            <p>As a disclaimer, I’ve done my best to make this website as accessible as I can by using accessibility validators and following best practices where possible. If you notice anything that could be improved, please fill out the form on the Contact page.
