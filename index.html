            <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
            
            <p>My name’s Michelle, and I’m a master’s student at the School of Information. Ever since taking a Disability Studies course in undergrad, I’ve been interested in this topic. Naturally, then, I chose to create a website about disability rights activism!</p>

            <p>This website will focus on activism within the United States from 1817 to the present. I know there’s much going on in this space around the world. However, I didn’t want to oversimplify each country’s activism and figured it was best to stick to one country.</p>
    

            <h2>There are four other pages-please see below for a description of each.</h2>
            <div class="page_descriptions">
            <p><span>Legislation</span>: The Legislation page outlines important disability laws passed in the U.S. This page is in the format of flip cards, and the cards are keyboard accessible!</p>

            <p><span>People</span>: This page provides bios on 9 figures in the disability rights movement. I tried to be inclusive and wrote about individuals whose activism spans a wide range of disability identities.</p>

            <p><span>Resources</span>: The Resources page is divided into two sections. The Further Reading section provides links to books about disability identity and activism. The References section includes a list of resources when creating the content for this website.</p>
        </div>
            <p>As far as accessibility, I’ve used accessibility validators and following best practices where possible. I’m only human, so if you see anything that could be improved please fill out the form on the Contact page!</p>
